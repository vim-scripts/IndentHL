Tabs and spaces are colored in slightly different colors from lightest to
darkest for dark background or from darkest to lightest for light background
example (x is darkest color and z lightest):

    function foo()
    x if b
    x y echo &#039something&#039
    x y while c
    x y z echo &#039something else&#039
    x y endwhile
    x endif
    endfunction
    
Actually it forms vertical stripes

You can switch it off and on by 
   :call OnOffIndentHi()
